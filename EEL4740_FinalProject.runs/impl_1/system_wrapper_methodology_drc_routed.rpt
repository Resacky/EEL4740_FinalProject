There is a large setup violation of -4.800 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/m01_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/r.r_pipe/m_payload_i_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/xbar/inst/gen_sasd.crossbar_sasd_0/reg_slice_r/m_payload_i_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
